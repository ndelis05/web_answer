sample_question = "How should I treat localized cellulitis in an otherwise normal patient?"
sample_response = """Localized cellulitis in an otherwise healthy patient is typically treated with antibiotics. The choice of antibiotic can depend on the suspected causative organism, usually Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.

Here are some general steps for treating localized cellulitis:

1. **Oral Antibiotics**: For a healthy patient with localized cellulitis, oral antibiotics are usually the first line of treatment. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include cephalexin or dicloxacillin. If MRSA is suspected, doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used.

2. **Monitor the Patient**: It's important to monitor the patient's response to treatment. Improvement should be seen within a few days. If the cellulitis doesn't improve, the patient may need to be reevaluated and possibly switched to a different antibiotic.

3. **Supportive Care**: Encourage the patient to rest and elevate the affected area to help reduce swelling. Over-the-counter pain relievers can also be used to manage discomfort.

4. **Prevention**: Good skin hygiene can help prevent future episodes of cellulitis. This includes keeping the skin clean and moisturized, promptly treating any cuts or scrapes, and using a moisturizer to prevent skin cracking.

Remember, this is a general guideline and the treatment may vary based on the patient's specific condition and response to medication. Always consult with a healthcare professional for the most appropriate treatment."""

This information should help answer questions following your knee replacement operation for optimal recovery.

Medicines: We’ve given you some medicines to help with your pain and swelling. Always take them as we've told you, do not take more than the amount we've said.

Morning pills: 
    Tylenol - 1000 mg - This is for your pain
    Celebrex - 100 mg - This is to stop swelling
    Lisinopril - 20 mg - This is for your blood pressure

Afternoon pills: 
    Tylenol - 1000 mg - This is for your pain

Night-time pills: 
    Tylenol - 1000 mg - This is for your pain

Physical Therapy: You should start doing your physical therapy exercises a couple days after your surgery. Try your best to do them regularly so you can get better faster.

Activity Levels: Moving around can help you get better, but getting enough rest is also very important. Until the doctor says you can, avoid lifting heavy things or overdoing it.

Caring for Your Wound: Keep your wound clean and dry. After taking off the bandage, use clean soap and water to gently clean around it.

Follow-ups: Going to all of your follow-up appointments is very important. We will see how well you’re doing and we can help with any problems.

Appointment 1: [Date and Time] - [Specialty]
Appointment 2: [Date and Time] - [Specialty]

Diet: Eating healthy food can help your body heal. Try to eat plenty of protein like chicken, fish or beans.

Watching for problems: If your surgical area hurts a lot, looks red or puffy, starts leaking fluid, or if you get a fever (feel very hot), get medical help right away.

Emergency Contact: If something doesn’t feel right, don’t wait. Immediately get in touch with your doctor or go to your nearest emergency department.

Phone: [Clinic's Phone Number]

Remember, getting better takes time. Being patient, taking good care of yourself, and following this guide will help you recover. Even though it might be hard, remember we’re here to help you every step of the way.

*Moderate Probability:*
1. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):** The patient's history of smoking also makes COPD a potential diagnosis, but this wouldn't typically cause a mass on the chest X-ray.
2. **Tuberculosis (TB):** If the patient has been exposed to TB, this could explain his symptoms and the mass, particularly if the mass is a result of a Ghon complex or calcified granuloma.
3. **Pneumonia:** Although less likely given the duration of symptoms and presence of a mass, a complicated pneumonia could potentially appear as a mass on a chest X-ray.
4. **Pulmonary Abscess:** Similar to pneumonia, an abscess could potentially appear as a mass, though this is less likely without other signs of acute infection.
5. **Fungal Infection:** Certain fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis or aspergillosis, can mimic cancer on imaging and cause chronic respiratory symptoms, particularly in certain geographic areas or with certain exposures.


*Lower Probability:*
1. **Sarcoidosis:** This is less common, but can cause similar symptoms and imaging findings.
2. **Lung Adenoma or Pulmonary Hamartoma:** These benign tumors could theoretically cause a mass, but are less likely and typically don't cause symptoms unless they're large.
3. **Silicosis:** Given the patient's occupational exposure, this could be a consideration, but typically causes a more diffuse process rather than a single mass.

alt_dx_sample_answer = """Constrictive pericarditis is a relatively rare condition that can be challenging to diagnose, given that its symptoms can be similar to those of several other cardiovascular and systemic disorders. The following is a list of some alternative diagnoses a clinician might consider if initially suspecting constrictive pericarditis:

1. Restrictive Cardiomyopathy: Similar to constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy can cause reduced filling of the ventricles and can result in similar signs and symptoms.

2. Right Heart Failure: The symptoms of right heart failure such as peripheral edema, ascites, and jugular venous distention can mimic constrictive pericarditis.

3. Tricuspid Regurgitation: The backflow of blood into the right atrium due to valve dysfunction can cause symptoms that overlap with those of constrictive pericarditis.

4. Pericardial Effusion or Tamponade: Fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac can also mimic the symptoms of constrictive pericarditis.

5. Hepatic Cirrhosis: This can cause ascites and peripheral edema, symptoms that can resemble those of constrictive pericarditis.

6. Nephrotic Syndrome: Characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, nephrotic syndrome can cause systemic symptoms that may be mistaken for constrictive pericarditis.

7. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or Cor Pulmonale: These conditions can cause right-sided heart symptoms that can resemble those of constrictive pericarditis.

8. Pulmonary Hypertension: This condition increases pressure on the right side of the heart and can mimic symptoms of constrictive pericarditis.

9. Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome: This condition, often caused by a malignancy or thrombosis in the SVC, can present with symptoms similar to constrictive pericarditis.

10. Constrictive Bronchiolitis: Although primarily a pulmonary condition, severe cases can affect the cardiovascular system and mimic constrictive pericarditis.

These are just a few of the conditions that could be considered in a differential diagnosis when constrictive pericarditis is suspected. As with any diagnostic process, a thorough patient history, physical examination, and appropriate investigations are key to reaching an accurate diagnosis."""
